        <h3>MOVE FOR EQUALITY</h3>
        <p>To send a strong message in the on-going fight for a more fair society,
            we decided to break a rule in one of the most traditional sports there is: chess.

        <h3>The Move</h3>
        <p>For one brief hour, Magnus and Anish put their rivalry aside to play a symbolic game that could truly make a
            difference.
            Watch the video below to see the symbolic move they made today. The game itself had no single winner.
            Because this
            should be a victory for anyone who dreams about a more equal world.

        <h3>Website</h3>
        <p>Besides the hashtag, the posts also directed viewers to the website where all the information about the
            campaign and
            what to do about it was hosted. The move was also replicated in other channels, like the Play Magnus chess
            app, one of
            the biggest in the market, not to mention a 12-hour live featuring other professional players playing random
            users with
            black starting.
