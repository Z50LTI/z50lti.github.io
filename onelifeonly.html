        <h3>ONE LIFE ONLY</h3>
        <p>
            Suicide is the second most common cause of death between young people. Those who are in a serious crisis often have the
            feeling that they are in free fall. But often it is not possible for those affected to talk about their problems.
            Because suicide is still a taboo topic in our society. Only those who talk about it can find support again - and stop
            the case.

            <h4>Jonas Monar <br> turns 
            a hashtag into <br> a song.</h4>
            <p>The singer-songwriter Jonas Monar released a song to the public specially composed for the campaign. "#DuBistMirWichtig"
            / "#YouMatterToMe" is the song title and at the same time the campaign hashtag. The song became the artist's most
            successful single. In the song, he breaks the silence and speaks about personal experiences with the topic of suicide. A
            music video and radio appearances spread the song and its message within the music community.</p>

                <h4>A mobile game
                you can only
                play once.</h4>
                <p>Just like in real life, every gamer only has one life. And the game can only be played once. The player controls a
                character who loses the ground underneath his feet and falls deeper and deeper into the darkness of depression. The aim
                is to stay in the light for as long as possible by capturing heart-shaped balloons and avoiding the mind monsters that
                drag you down.</p>

                <h4>And the game <br> transforms into a help <br> messenger.</h4>
                <p>After playing the game, it can no longer be played. But the app continues living on their mobile phones, transforming
                itself into a direct helpline messenger to the folks at Caritas suicide prevention. So that help is immediately
                available in case of a crises situation.</p>

            <h4>The Campagin Website</h4>
            <p>All traffic the campaign creates is funneled to the microsite dubistmirwichtig.de (meaning: You are important to me)
            where further information, interviews from suicide survivors and help are provided to anyone that was looking for it.
            The character of a young man that feels like he is constantly falling deeper into the darkness of depression navigates
            the user through the content. This creates a more connected experience with the topic and how it feels like to live with
            depression and suicidal thoughts. <br> <br> <br>
            
            The endless scrolling loop mechanic of the website leads the user through the dark inner feeling back to the light at
            the beginning of the experience. A symbol of hope. Because by bringing the dark, inner thoughts to light and sharing
            them with others is the first step to survival.</p>

                <h4>Let's talk about suicide.</h4>
                <p>Sometimes you can see when someone is in crisis and needs help. And sometimes you can draw strength from your own
                experiences to help these people.</p>
