        <h3>ANGEL’S SOULS</h3>
        <p>The Demon Souls’ remake for PS5 is known for its threatening duels amongst players. And things can get heated when a
        player invades another one’s world to fight them and - should they win - steal their souls. But instead of doing that,
        game streamers have been doing quite the opposite. They invaded several players’ worlds not to steal their life, but to
        donate.

        <br><br>The gamers ‘donated life’ in the virtual world to send a message to the Demon’s Soul community that everyone can 'donate
        life' in the real world too, by registering themselves as living organ donors.
        <br><br>
        The stunt was pulled by the agency BBDO Germany and the NYC based group Save One Person, an organisation that connects
        living donors to patients who have been in line for transplant via an App. According to Save One Person, currently there
        are more than 114,000 people waiting for an organ in the United States alone. And as stated by the World Health
        Organisation, it is estimated that all the recent organ donations correspond to less than 10% of the global need.
