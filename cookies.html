        <h2>What are cookies?
        </h2>
        <p>A cookie is a small simple file that is sent along with pages of our website and stored by your browser on
            the hard
            drive of your computer or other device. The information stored in it may be returned to our servers or to
            the servers of
            the relevant third parties on a subsequent visit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cookies transmit small amounts of data about your device to our web server. They enable websites to
            recognise your
            computer, smartphone, or other device when you browse the internet. Tracking pixels, pixels, JavaScript and
            other
            tracking technologies also use cookies, invisible images or invisible codes that collect data about a user's
            visit to
            the website in a similar way to cookies. Depending on how long a cookie remains stored, we may refer to
            cookies as
            session cookies or persistent cookies:

        </p>

        <p><i>i) Session cookies<br></i>
            A session cookie allows a website to recognise you while you browse the website. A session cookie, however,
            is deleted
            when you log out or close the website in your browser.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>ii) Permanent cookies<br></i>
            A persistent cookie recognises you again and again for a set period of time. It remains stored on your
            device or in your
            browser for a certain period (which can be minutes, days, or months) after you have logged out or closed the
            browser.
            Persistent cookies are used, for example, to store certain settings you have made on a website (such as your
            preferred
            language).

        </p>

        <h2>Cookies we use</h2>
        <p>The cookies that may be used by us can further be categorised as:</p>
        <p>
            <i> i) Essential or Necessary cookies <br></i>
            These cookies are needed to ensure that this website works properly and is secure so that you can navigate
            the website
            and use its features. At the same time, we store your preferences regarding our use of cookies on your
            device. Without
            these cookies, certain features of the website would not be available, and you would also not be able to use
            certain
            services. These cookies do not collect any of your data for marketing purposes and they are not used to
            monitor your
            activity on the internet generally.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i> ii) Functional cookies<br></i>
            These cookies allow a website to remember the options you have selected and any custom settings you have
            made (e.g.,
            font sizes) or personalisation options you have selected when browsing. It may also be used to provide you
            with certain
            services that you may use.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i> iii) Analysis and performance cookies<br></i>
            These cookies are used to monitor and improve the function and service of our website. They can also help us
            track down
            problems you may encounter when using our website. These cookies may be used to facilitate online surveys,
            record
            visitor numbers, and provide other website analytics metrics. These cookies are not used to provide you with
            targeted
            online advertising. Without these cookies, we have limited information about how well our website is
            performing and are
            limited in our ability to make necessary usability improvements.

            When you visit our website for the first time, we will show you a pop-up with a brief explanation about

            We use the Google Analytics service of <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US">Google Inc.</a> to analyse our website visits. Google uses the
            above-mentioned

            activity
