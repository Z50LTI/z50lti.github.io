            <hr class="hr-red">

            <p class="textcentered">Content marketing is essential for your business to succeed nowadays. It not only
                communicates the value and expertise
                of your company but, when done correctly, it will create a constant stream of potential new customers
                for your business.
                To achieve this, content needs to be written strategically to target key terms that are relevant to the
                needs of those
                you’re trying to reach.

                    <h4>Why Copy Matters</h4>
                    <p>You can write the best copy in the world but if it’s not written in the correct way for search
                        engines, it won’t drive
                        the desired traffic. Writing for search also helps focus content on solving your customers’
                        needs therefore increasing
                        conversion rates.</p>

            <p class="textcentered">Link building is key to ranking higher in search. It tells Google that other
                websites think your content is good and
                that you are a trustworthy source of information. Backlinks to your site act as references for your
                business. Just as
                you would want to know that anyone you hire has good references; search engines want to know that others
                recommend your
                site and they do this by linking to it. The more authority those who recommend you have, the better.

            <p>I’ve worked with a lot of SEO companies before and the analysis and reports from Atilom SEO are by far
                the most detailed
                I’ve ever encountered. They really get into the nitty-gritty of how you can improve your search presence
                and drive more
                traffic to your website.

                </span>

            </p>


            <p>I hired Atilom SEO to take care of our Digital Marketing. They explained how they would proceed and
                advised us on what
                we needed to do in order to increase our online presence. I am delighted with the work they've done and
                have recommended
                them to other business owners in Hong Kong.
                <span>Amandine de Mascarel, CEO of TUNIQUE</span>

            </p>

            <p>I have worked with Atilom SEO for a year and throughout have been very impressed by the quality of their
                work. Their
                ability to write strong copy on a variety of subjects on time and to brief made them a valuable asset to
                Skyscanner's
                team. I highly recommend them to editors looking for writers who know how to find a balance between
                writing for people
                and SEO.
