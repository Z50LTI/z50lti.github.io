														country your information may be held. <br><br> Countries in which your information may be held will have privacy and data protection laws that may differ from those of
														Australia and overseas organisations may be required to disclose information that the Blue Asia Capital has shared with
														them, under foreign laws – in such circumstances, you may not hold the Blue Asia Capital liable for such disclosure. <br><br> If we disclose your personal information outside Australia, we comply with transborder data ﬂow privacy standards under

															</li>
														
														</ul>

														<p class="text_7">Employee record exemption</p>

														<p class="marg_9">In Australia, this Privacy Policy does not apply to personal information provided to, held, or used by the Blue Asia
