                        <h3>OUR STORY</h3>
                        <hr class="line">
                    </div>

                    <p>As a food scientist, Nicholas Jose’s usual routine involves compounding citrus oils, handling
                        liquid nitrogen, and
                        participating in triangle tests. Although he was adept at what he does from 9-5, at the end of
                        the day, he left work
                        with a missing feeling he couldn’t quite put his finger on. <br><br>

                        Then, in mid-2022, Nicholas was struck with a compelling idea:<br><br>

                        <i>“What if I started a mobile bar business?”</i><br><br>

                        This was the question that ultimately got the snowball rolling. The thought of starting your own
                        business and becoming
                        your own boss was an intimidating thought, to say the least, but Nicholas knew that this
                        opportunity was exactly what he
                        was looking for.<br><br>

                        <i><b>Blending citrus oils for a corporation was one thing, but mixing, shaking, stirring, and
                                even torching cocktails for
                                enthusiastic guests at a party was an experience no lab could ever copy.</b></i>
                        <br><br>

                        And so, in July 2022, Nicholas founded The Silver Glass Mobile Bar, LLC; and from September 2022
                        to February 2023, he –
                        with some help from his younger brother, who is skilled in woodcrafting – built the “Silver
                        Bar”, a full-service bar
                        with wheels and a self-contained sink system.<br><br>

                        We thank you so much for having an interest in us. No matter what the occassion is, The Silver
                        Glass Mobile Bar is
                        always looking forward to serve you and your guests, as well as to share unforgettable memories
                        and experiences!

                    <p>To get started, first check to see if 1) your venue’s
                        policy
                        allows outside vendors, 2) there is enough space for our mobile bar to setup, and 3) the mobile
                        bar
                        has access
                        to power,
                        or if an electric generator will be needed. Once you have gathered all the details for your
                        event,
                        fill out and

                        (If the client chose to pay the final amount of the invoice in cash, we will collect the final

                        the bar.) Once everything has been set up, the bar is officially open!

                            to purchase. This
                            flexibility not only allows you to buy your alcohol at retail price, with no additional
                            markup, and at any liquor store,
                            but you can also select your favorite brands and save money. Additionally, any unopened
                            bottles of alcohol can simply be
                            returned – or saved for a later party!</p>

                            location greater than 20 miles away, we will charge a travel fee of $2.00 per mile, both
                            ways, to cover for gas and

                            drinking age. Serving alcohol to minors is illegal and we take this offense very seriously.

                        <p>A: A 50% retainer fee and a signed contract is required to reserve the date and time for your
                            event. The retainer fee is
                            non-refundable, as we’ve turned away other clients in order to reserve your date. If you
                            cancel your event at least 14
                            days prior to the event date, we will waive the remaining balance of the total fees agreed
                            upon; otherwise, cancelling
                            your event within the 14-day time frame will require you to make the full remaining payment
                            to us that’s due before the
                            event date. In the event that The Silver Glass Mobile Bar cancels on you, all monies paid to
                            us will be fully refunded.</p>

                            inclement weather conditions. We can, however, accommodate a rain date within one week of
                            your booked event so long as
                            your chosen rain date is available. Otherwise, we are more than happy to work with your

                            size tent for our mobile bar. Tent size must be more than 9 ft tall for our mobile bar to

                            venue does require such a permit, it is the client’s responsibility to obtain it. If you

                            permits, please contact your local municipality or police department for more information.

                        <p>A: Because our mobile “Silver Bar” is one of a kind, our availability is very limited.
