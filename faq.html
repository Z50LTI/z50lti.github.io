            <h3>What is Dolby Atmos?</h3>
          </div>

          <p>
            Dolby Atmos is the fastest growing audio format. It gives Stereo
            mixes new life by wrapping the sound field around the listener.
            Dolby Atmos uses binaural rendering to create an immersive surround
            sound experience, even in headphones!

            <h3>Does Spatio use a Dolby approved studio?</h3>
          </div>

          <p>
            Yes. Spatio uses Lounge Studios NYC, a Dolby approved Atmos facility
            listed on the Dolby website. We have 6 equipped Atmos studios, and
            we also have a network with over 20 other Dolby-approved Atmos

          </div>

            It's Okay! You can also use the mixed acappella and instrumental of
            your final mix.

            If while using our stem verification system your stems do not match
            your final mix, you can re-export or bounce your stems from your
            song’s final mix session. Click Learn How below.

            <h3>Can I listen to my Atmos mix once it is done?</h3>
          </div>

          <p>
            Yes. You will receive a BIN file that you can use to listen to your
            Atmos mix using your headphones on any device. BIN files can only be

          <p>
            You will receive two files from us. The larger file is your ADM.wav
            file. The ADM file cannot be played by you, outside of an Atmos
            studio. This file is to be delivered to your distributor. The second
            smaller file is a BIN file. This file can be played on all of your
            devices using headphones only.

          </div>

          <p>
            The larger ADM file should be uploaded to your music distributor.

            All revisions are done via a virtual session in real time with an

            revised to help the engineer perfect it to your liking.
