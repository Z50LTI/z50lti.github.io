              We collect information on the devices that you use to access our
              Services. This information includes things like your IP address,
              web browser and the device that you use, the webpage that linked

              cookies, you might not be able to use all of our Services’
              features;
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              We may also combine information that we collect through our
