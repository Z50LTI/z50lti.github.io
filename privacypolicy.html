        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Thank you for your interest in this Privacy Policy! Data protection is a high priority for us. In principle,
            the use of
            our website is possible without any indication of personal data (with the exception of IP addresses).
            However, if you
            want to use our Services some personal data may be required.</p>
        <h2>What is Personal Data?</h2>
        <p>Personal data is any information relating to personal or material circumstances that relates to an identified
            or
            identifiable individual. This includes, for example, your name, date of birth, e-mail address, postal
            address, or
            telephone number as well as online identifiers such as your IP address. In contrast, information of a
            general nature
            that cannot be used to determine your identity is not personal data. This includes, for example, the number
            of users of
            a website.</p>
        <p>
            In principle, we will only use your personal data in accordance with the applicable data protection laws, in
            particular
            the UK`s Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA), the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), and only as
            described in this
            Privacy Policy.

        <h2>General information on data processing
        </h2>
        <p>In the course of our business and website operations, we process data. This also includes disclosure by
            transmission to
            third parties and, where applicable, to so-called third countries outside the UK and the EEA. Where we
            transfer data
            outside the UK or EEA, we have highlighted this accordingly below.
        </p>
        <h2>Your Rights
        </h2>
        <p>Below we inform you about the rights to which you as a Data Subject may be entitled to. These rights are
            standardised in
            both the DPA and GDPR and include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The right to information,
            </li>
            <li>The right to erasure,
            </li>
            <li>The right to rectification,
            </li>
            <li>The right to data portability,
            </li>
            <li>The right to restriction of data processing,
            </li>
            <li>
                The right to object to data processing.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To assert these rights, please contact us at any time using the details provided. You also have the right to
            lodge a
            complaint with your local data protection supervisory authority or the Information Commissioner`s Office
            (ICO), which is
            the relevant authority in the UK.</p>
        <p>The ICO is located at Wycliffe House, Water Ln, Wilmslow SK9 5AF, UK and their website can be found at <a
                href="www.ico.org.uk">www.ico.org.uk</a>.
            We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO or any other
            supervisory
            authority.
        </p>

        <p>The above rights may be limited in some circumstances, for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal
            Personal
            Data about another person, if you ask us to delete information which we are required to have by law, or if
            we have
            compelling legitimate interests to keep it.
        </p>

        <p>We will let you know if that is the case and will then only use your information for these purposes. You may
            also be
            unable to continue using our services if you want us to stop processing your Personal Data.
        </p>

        <h2>Data processing on our website
        </h2>
        <p>In the following sections, we explain the individual data processed, the purposes of processing, the legal
            bases,
            recipients and, where applicable, transfers to third countries.

            basis of our legitimate interests in an efficient and secure provision of the website and services in
            conjunction with
            the provision of contractual services and the conclusion of the contract for our services, including but not
            limited to
            our services).

        </p>

        <p>
            <i>b) Collection of access data and log files<br></i>
            We, or rather Bluehost on our behalf, collect data on every access to our website on the basis of our

            maximum of 7
            days and then deleted. Data whose further storage is necessary for evidentiary purposes is exempt from
            deletion until
            the respective incident is finally clarified.

            purpose of
            processing and handling your enquiry: Name, contact details -if provided by you- and your message. The legal
            basis of
            the data processing is our obligation to fulfil the contract and/or to fulfil our pre-contractual

            we process
            your data and all other information that is necessary in the context of fulfilling the services, exclusively
            for the
            purpose of processing and handling the contractual relationship. Accordingly, the data is processed on the
            basis of a

            <i>e) Use of cookies<br>
            </i>
            We use so-called cookies on our website. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your respective

            smartphone, tablet, etc.) and saved by your browser. For further information please refer to our Cookie

        <h2>Third Party Services
        </h2>

        <p>We are entitled to outsource the processing of your personal data in whole or in part to external service
            providers
            acting as processors for us within the framework of the DPA and GDPR. External service providers support us,
            for
            example, in the technical operation and support of the website, data management, the provision and
            performance of
            services, analysis, as well as the implementation and fulfilment of reporting obligations.
        </p>
        <p>
            The service providers commissioned by us process your data exclusively in accordance with our instructions.
            However, we
            remain responsible for the protection of your data, which is ensured by strict contractual regulations,
            technical and
            organisational measures and additional controls by us.

        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Google Analytics<br>
            </i>
            We use Google Analytics, a service provided by <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en">Google Inc</a>. This means that the data collected can in
            principle be
            transmitted to a Google server in the USA, whereby the IP addresses are anonymised by means of IP
            anonymisation so that
            an allocation is not possible. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will
            not be merged
            with other Google data. You can object to the collection and processing of this data by Google Analytics by
            setting an
            opt-out cookie that prevents the future collection of your data when you visit this website: <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>. The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate
            interest and your
            consent.
        </p>
        <h2>Duration of data storage
        </h2>
        <p>
            We only store personal data for as long as it is necessary for the purposes for which it is processed or for
            as long as
            any consent you have given us has been revoked by you. Insofar as statutory retention obligations must be
            observed, the
            storage period for certain data may be up to 6 years, irrespective of the processing purposes.

        </p>
        <h2>Transfer of personal data
        </h2>
        <p>
            We will not disclose or otherwise distribute your personal data to third parties unless this is necessary
            for the
            performance of our services, you have consented to the disclosure, or the disclosure of data is permitted by
            relevant
            legal provisions.

        </p>
        <p>
            Personal data may also be disclosed to third parties if we are legally obliged to do so e.g., by court order
            or if this
            is necessary to support criminal or legal investigations or other legal investigations or proceedings at
            home or abroad
            or to fulfil our legitimate interests.

        </p>
        <h2>Automated decision-making
        </h2>
        <p>
            Automated decision-making including profiling pursuant to Art. 22 (1) and (4) GDPR does not take place.

        </p>
        <h2>Security
        </h2>
        <p>State-of-the-art internet technologies are used to ensure the security of your data. In addition, technical
            and
            organisational security measures are used to protect the personal data you have provided against accidental
            or
            intentional manipulation, loss, destruction, or access by unauthorised persons.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nonetheless, databases or data sets that include Personal Data may be breached inadvertently or through
            wrongful
            intrusion. Upon becoming aware of a data breach, I will notify all affected individuals whose Personal Data
            may have
            been compromised, and the notice will be accompanied by a description of action being taken to reconcile any
            damage as a
            result of the data breach. Notices will be provided as expeditiously as possible after which the breach was
            discovered.

        </p>
        <h2>Accuracy and updating your information
        </h2>
        <p>
            If you believe that the information, we hold about you is inaccurate or that we are no longer entitled to
            use it and
            want to request its rectification, deletion, or object to its processing, please contact us. For your
            protection and the
            protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above
            requests.

        </p>
        <p>
            Keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons, including if the request is unlawful or if it may
            infringe on
            trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy of another user. Also, we may not be able to
            accommodate certain
            requests to object to the processing of Personal Data, notably where such requests would not allow us to
            provide our
            service to you anymore.

        </p>
        <h2>Links to other providers
        </h2>
        <p>Our website also contains - clearly recognisable - links to the websites of other companies. Insofar as there
            are links
            to websites of other providers, we have no influence on their contents. Therefore, no guarantee or liability
            can be
            assumed for these contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the
            content of
            these pages.
        </p>
        <p>The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations and recognisable infringements at the time of
            linking.
            Illegal contents were not recognisable at the time of linking. However, permanent monitoring of the content
            of the
            linked pages is not reasonable without concrete indications of a legal violation. Such links will be removed
            immediately
            if infringements of the law become known.
        </p>
        <h2>Personal Data and children
        </h2>
        <p>
            Our services are aimed at people aged 18 and over. We will not knowingly collect, use or disclose Personal
            Data from
            minors under the age of 18 without first obtaining consent from a legal guardian through direct offline
            contact.

        </p>
        <h2>Changes and updates to the privacy policy
        </h2>
        <p>We kindly ask you to regularly inform yourself about the content of our privacy policy. We will amend the
            privacy policy
            as soon as changes to the information processing activities we carry out make this necessary. We will inform
            you as soon
            as the changes require an act of cooperation on your part (e.g., consent) or other individual notification.
        </p>
